Here’s a **clean, well-structured, GitHub-ready rewrite** of your README section.
Nothing is removed — it’s just **clearer, easier to scan, and more professional** (exactly what recruiters want).

You can **paste this directly into your `README.md`**.

# Europe_Agri_msc-da-sept-24-sem-1-ca2

## 📌 Overview

This project explores how **data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning** can be applied to drive **innovation and sustainability in Irish agriculture**.

The study evaluates the performance of multiple machine learning models across both **classification and regression tasks**, with a strong focus on:

* Hyperparameter optimisation
* Model evaluation
* Statistical inference

This project was completed as part of my **MSc in Data Analytics**.

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)**
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
* Multinomial Naive Bayes

---

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Optimisation & Validation

* **GridSearchCV** was used to identify optimal hyperparameters for each model
* **Cross-validation** was applied to ensure robust, reliable, and unbiased model performance

---

If you’d like, I can:

* Add a **Results section** with metrics formatted cleanly
* Write a **“How to Run”** section
* Align this README stylistically with your **other MSc projects**
* Make a **short recruiter-friendly summary** at the top

Just tell me 👍
