* Features were cleaned and prepared prior to model training

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
* Multinomial Naive Bayes

---

### ⚙️ Hyperparameter Optimisation & Validation

* **GridSearchCV** was used to identify optimal hyperparameters for each model
* **Cross-validation** ensured robust, reliable, and unbiased performance estimates

---

## 📈 Results & Evaluation

### 🔹 Classification Performance

Models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* Cohen’s Kappa

**Key Results:**

* Multinomial Naive Bayes: **0.59** cross-validation accuracy
* Logistic Regression: **0.58** cross-validation accuracy

Both models demonstrated competitive performance in classification tasks.
