# Europe_Agri_msc-da-sept-24-sem-1-ca2

📌 Overview

This project investigates how data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning can be leveraged to support innovation and sustainability within Irish agriculture.
The study evaluates the performance of multiple machine learning models across both classification and regression tasks, 
with a strong emphasis on hyperparameter optimisation, model evaluation, and statistical inference.

The project was completed as part of my MSc in Data Analytics.

🧠 Technologies & Tools:
Python
Pandas, NumPy,
Scikit-learn,
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE),
Matplotlib / Seaborn.


Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest,
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN),
Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Hyperparameter Optimisation,
GridSearchCV was employed to identify optimal hyperparameters for each model.
Cross-validation was used to ensure robust and reliable model performance.

📈 Model Evaluation
Classification Metrics:
Accuracy,
Precision
Recall
Cohen’s Kappa

Results:
Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 0.59

Logistic Regression achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 0.58

Random Forest achieved an R² score of 0.94

KNN achieved an R² score of 0.88

Residual plots were generated to assess model fit and error distribution
